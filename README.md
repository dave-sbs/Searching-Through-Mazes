# Searching-Through-Mazes
Implementing different maze search algorithms, namely, BFS, DFS, and A* Searching algorithms to get from the target node to the finish node. Each Searching algorithm would have its own unique way of working through the maze primarily defined by the properties of the data structure it uses.
