# Searching-Through-Mazes
A Java program that showcases different searching algorithms as they are used to navigate through a maze.

## Project Description
Implementing different maze search algorithms, namely, BFS, DFS, and A* Searching algorithms, to get from the target node to the finish node. Each Searching algorithm would have its own unique way of working through the maze primarily defined by the properties of the data structure it utilizes.

## Installation
To get started with the To Do List Web App locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/dave-sbs/Searching-Through-Mazes.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Searching-Through-Mazes Files/Exploration.java

## Usage
Once in Exploration.java, the user has the option to adjust the size of the maze and set one of three Search Algorithms. 
Instructions within the code are provided in the form of comments just above the code.
Follow the instructions and finally run the code. 

## Technologies Used
The Searching Through Mazes program is built using:
- Java

## Features
- Adjust and control size of grid
- A selection of three well-known Search Algorithms

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you would like to contribute to the project, please follow these guidelines:
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make your changes and test them thoroughly.
3. Submit a pull request describing your changes and their purpose.
Please adhere to the existing coding style and ensure that your code is well-documented.
Please note that this is a school project and so certain elements such as the MazeSearchDisplay class were provided by my professors and are, in my opinion, a bit outdated. So please feel free to implement better versions.
